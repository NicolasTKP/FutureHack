# Lazada Veracity Checker
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `review_shopee_malay.csv`
- **File:** `shopee_reviews.csv`

## Model Details
### Metadata Features 
- `review_length`: total number of words in the review
- `user_review_count`: total reviews posted by that user
- `user_avg_rating`: average rating the user gives
- `review_frequency`: frequency of reviews by the user (static value if no date available)
- `has_image`: whether the review includes an image
- `language`: detected language (e.g., English, Malay)

> Output saved to: `metadata_features.csv`

### Similar Review Detection with FAISS

Memory-efficient semantic similarity detection using **TF-IDF vectorization + FAISS** for large datasets.

**Process**:
1. Limited data to last 1,000 reviews for efficiency: `df.tail(1000)`
2. Applied `TfidfVectorizer` to convert reviews to numeric vectors
3. Used **Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS)** to find top similar review pairs
4. Filtered results with similarity threshold: `score > 0.85`

> Output saved to: `cosine_similar_reviews_faiss.csv`

## Performance
```
FAISS Similarity Search
Limited dataset to 1,000 most recent reviews to optimize memory usage and runtime.

FAISS approximate nearest neighbor search returned top-5 similar reviews per entry in milliseconds.

Applied a similarity threshold of 0.85 to filter highly similar pairs.

**Sample Output**:
| review_id_1 | review_id_2 | similarity_score | product_id |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 46          | 457         | 1.0              | eng_product |
| 130         | 4           | 1.0              | eng_product |
| 177         | 897         | 0.898            | eng_product |
```

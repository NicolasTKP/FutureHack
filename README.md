# Lazada Veracity Checker
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `fake reviews dataset (new).xlsx`
- **Columns Used:**
  - `text_`: the review text
  - `rating`: numerical rating given by the user
  - `label`: binary target 
## Model Details
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Lowercasing
  - Removal of punctuation/numbers
  - Stopword removal using NLTK
- **Features:**
  - TF-IDF vectorized review text (max 5000 features)
  - Review length (word count)
  - Rating (1â€“5 scale)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
  - ROC-AUC Score

# Bot Generated Review Detection Model
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `fake reviews dataset (new).xlsx`
  **Columns Used:**
  - `text_`: the review text
  - `rating`: numerical rating given by the user
  - `label`: binary target 
## Model Details
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Lowercasing
  - Removal of punctuation/numbers
  - Stopword removal using NLTK
- **Features:**
  - TF-IDF vectorized review text (max 5000 features)
  - Review length (word count)
  - Rating (1–5 scale)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
  - ROC-AUC Score

## Installation
**Install the following python dependency**

```python
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk openpyxl joblib
```
## Model file

```

## Structure of Bot-Generated Review Detection
This repository contains a trained detection system for identifying bot-generated product reviews. The structure of the main modules is shown below:
```python
bot_review_detection/
├── model_training/
│ └── train.py # Script to preprocess data and train the logistic regression model
├── inference/
│ └── predict.py # Script to load the model and make predictions
├── utils/
│ └── text_cleaning.py # Text preprocessing and stopword removal
├── data/
│ └── fake_reviews.xlsx # Dataset with columns: text_, rating, label
└── Bot_Generated_Detection_Model.pkl # Trained model file
```
The model requires three main input fields:
- **text_**: The product review content.
- **rating**: The numeric rating given (1–5).
- **label**: The ground truth class (0 = bot-generated, 1 = human-written).

The model uses TF-IDF for text feature extraction, combines it with numerical features (rating, review length), and applies a logistic regression classifier for detection.

You may edit the `text_cleaning.py` file to customize preprocessing rules.  
The training logic is located in `train.py` under `model_training/`.

The trained model is saved as `Bot_Generated_Detection_Model.pkl` for easy reuse during prediction.

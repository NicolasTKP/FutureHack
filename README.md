# Lazada Veracity Checker
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `fake reviews dataset (new).xlsx`

The dataset is designed to analyze user reviews to determine whether they are original or fake (computer generated).
## Model Details
**Bot-Generated Review Detection**

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to detect bot-generated (fake) reviews.
The model is trained to classify user reviews as either genuine (0) or fake (1) based on:
- The review text (text_)
- The numerical rating given by the user (rating)

## Performance

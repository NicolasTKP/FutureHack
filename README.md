# Lazada Veracity Checker
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `fake reviews dataset (new).xlsx`

The dataset consists of e-commerce product reviews, including both human-written and bot-generated reviews. It contains fields such as review text, user rating, and a label indicating whether the review was generated by a bot or not.

- **File:** `review_sentiment.csv`

The dataset consists of ratings and product reviews collected from e-commerce platform. It contains fields such as expected sentiment and vader sentiment to detect mismatches between given ratings and predicted sentiments.

## Model Details

**Bot-Generated Review Detection**

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to detect bot-generated (fake) reviews.
The model is trained to classify user reviews as either genuine (0) or fake (1) based on:
- The review text (text_)
- The numerical rating given by the user (rating)

**Review and Rating Sentiment Matching Model**

This project uses LinearSVC model to:
- Analyse the text sentiment of a product review
- Compare the result with the given rating
- Flag inconsistencies (difference between predicted rating and given rating >=2)
 
To solve the class imbalance in the training data, the project use the ```RandomOverSampler``` from the ```imbalanced-learn (imblearn)``` library. This ensures the model does not biased towards the majority sentiment class.

## Rule-Based Malicious Word Detection

 This project includes a rule-based module and a utility function to 
   - Detect and flag reviews that contain malicious or rude keywords
   - Identify toxic words in both English and Malay

## Rule-Based Similar Review Detection with FAISS

This project uses memory-efficient semantic similarity detection using **TF-IDF vectorization + FAISS** for large datasets.

FAISS Similarity Search
Limited dataset to 1,000 most recent reviews to optimize memory usage and runtime.

FAISS approximate nearest neighbor search returned top-5 similar reviews per entry in milliseconds.

Applied a similarity threshold of 0.85 to filter highly similar pairs.

**Sample Output**:
| review_id_1 | review_id_2 | similarity_score | product_id |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 46          | 457         | 1.0              | eng_product |
| 130         | 4           | 1.0              | eng_product |
| 177         | 897         | 0.898            | eng_product |

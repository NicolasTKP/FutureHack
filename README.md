# Lazada Veracity Checker
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to detect bot-generated (computer-generated) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms identify fake reviews that could mislead customers. The model analyzes the content of a review, like review length and rating, to predict whether the review is likely generated by a bot.
## Dataset
- **File:** `fake reviews dataset (new).xlsx`

The dataset consists of e-commerce product reviews, including both human-written and bot-generated reviews. It contains fields such as review text, user rating, and a label indicating whether the review was generated by a bot or not.
## Model Details

**Bot-Generated Review Detection**

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to detect bot-generated (fake) reviews.
The model is trained to classify user reviews as either genuine (0) or fake (1) based on:
- The review text (text_)
- The numerical rating given by the user (rating)

**Review and Rating Sentiment Matching Model**

   This project uses LinearSVC model to 
    - Analyse the text sentiment of a product review
    - Compare the result with the given rating
    - Flag inconsistencies (difference between predicted rating and given rating >=2)

## Rule-Based Malicious Word Detection
 This project includes a rule-based module and a utility function to 
   - Detect and flag reviews that contain malicious or rude keywords
   - Identify toxic words in both English and Malay
